/*
 * Lab #5: Infix to Postfix
 * 1) Ask the user to input an arithmetic expression in infix notation. The
 * expression may contain integers, operators, parenthesis and variables.
 * There should be a space between each item in your input expression.
 * 2) Convert the expression to postfix notation, using the algorithm on
 * page 348 in your textbook. You are required to use at least one stack
 * to create the expression
 * 3) Your input expression should contain only positive integers
 * 4) If the expression entered is not well formed, your program should
 * issue an error message telling the user that their input is in error, and
 * ask for another expression to evaluate (flush your stack!)
 * 5) Write your code to use a loop that allows the user to enter more
 * expressions until they indicate that they are finished.
 * 6) Extra Credit: using no variables in your input expression, only
 * integers and operators,…create the corresponding postfix expression,
 * print it, and then correctly evaluate the postfix expression.
